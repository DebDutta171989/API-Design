# PCI Data

We **SHOULD NOT transmit personally identifiable information (PII) parameters in the URL (as part of path or query string)** because this information can be inadvertently exposed via client, network, and server logs and other mechanisms. While all communication must be over SSL - weâ€™re protecting against humans (either making a genuine mistake, or those being more malicious).

Consequently, a service **SHOULD accept PII parameters transmitted as headers**.

However, there are many scenarios where the above recommendations cannot be followed due to client or software limitations. To address these limitations, services SHOULD also accept these PII parameters as part of the URL consistent with the rest of these guidelines.

Services that accept PII parameters -- whether in the URL or as headers -- SHOULD be compliant with our privacy policy. This will typically include recommending that clients prefer headers for transmission and implementations adhere to special precautions to ensure that logs and other service data collection are properly handled.
